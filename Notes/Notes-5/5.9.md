# 5.9 - this Keyword

The keyword **this** can be used in a class to refer to the current calling object.

```public class Person
{
    // instance variables
    private String name;

    // constructor
    public Person(String theName)
    {
        this.name = theName;   //if we have an object p1, this.name refers to p1's name.
    }

}
```
Static methods cannot refer to this or instance variables because they are called with the classname, not an object, so there is no this object.

The keyword this is sometimes used by programmers to distinguish between variables. Programmers can give the parameter variables the same names as the instance variables and this can distinguish them and avoid a naming conflict.

```
// instance variables
private String name;

// constructor
public Person(String name)
{
   // Set this object's instance variable name to the parameter variable name
   this.name = name;
}
```
