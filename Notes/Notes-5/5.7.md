# 5.7 - Static Variables and Methods

- Static variables and methods belong to a class and are called with the Class Name rather than using object variables, like ClassName.methodName();
```
Example: Math class
We call Math.random()
//random is a static method. We call with class name rather than creating an object of Math.
```
- There is only one copy of a static variable or method for the whole class. For example, the main method is static because there should only be 1 main method
- Static methods can be public or private
- Static methods only have access to other static variables and static methods
- Static methods cannot access or change the values of instance variables
- Static methods cannot call non-static methods
- However, non-static methods have access to all variables (instance or static) and methods (static or non-static) in the class
- Since there is only 1 copy of a static variable or method, static variables are often used to count how many objects are generated.
