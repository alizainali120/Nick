# 5.1 - Java Class

## Creating a Class
```
public class Student {
	// body of the class
}
```

We will have the keyword `public` before classes we write though it is optional. 
We write class names with first letter capitalized.

We can create instances of class with the `new` keyword and we can declare variables that can hold a reference to that class object. 

```
Student std1 = new Student();
Student ali = new Student();
```
The body of a class contains instance variables (attributes), constructors, and methods.

**Instance variables (attributes)**: This is the first thing we define in a class. Each object has its own set of variables that are not shared with other instances.
<br>

**Constructors**: The second thing we define in a class is usually its constructors. Constructor's role is to **initialize** variables when the object is created. We will discuss constructors in more detail in unit 5.2.
<br>

**Methods**: Methods define the behaviors of the objects of that class. Most methods either do things (complex calculations) or return values (getAge on Student). The methods of the class share access to object's attributes and when a method is called on an object, it uses the instance variables (attributes) for that object.

```
public class Student {
	// instance variables 
	// constructors
	// methods
}
```

**Main method**: any Java class can have a `main` method which can be used to run that class as a program either to test that one class or as the entry point to a whole program made up of many classes and objects.


## Designing a Class
When designing a class, we need to ask, what data does it represent? What would we want to know about a student? In one program, we might want to know student's grade and subject. In another program, we might want to know student's name, email and phone number (shown in example).

```
public class Student {
	// instance variables 
	private string name;
	private string email;
	private string phoneNumber;
	
	// constructor
	public Student(String initName, String initEmail, String initPhone) {
		name = initName;
		email = initEmail;
		phoneNumber = initPhone;
	}
	
	// print all data for a student 
	public void print() {
		System.out.println("Name:  " + name);
		System.out.println("Email:  " + email);
		System.out.println("Phone Number:  " + phoneNumber);
	}
	
	
	// main method for testing
	Public static void main (String[] args) {
		Student s1 = new Student("Ali", "alizainali@gmail.com", "773-818-5232");
		s1.print();
	}
}
```

## Instance Variables
In general, instance variables should be declared `private`. A `private` instance variable can only be accessed by code in the class that declares the variable.

The `Student` class declares 3 private instance variables: `name`, `email`, and `phoneNumber`. Once we have created a class like `Student`, we can create many instances (objects) of the class. The class is like a blueprint that defines the variables and methods for that class. Each object will have their own copies of the same instance variables but with possibly different values in them.

Good Java style ensures data encapsulation where the instance variables and methods acting on the instance variables are wrapped together into a single unit and the implementation details are hidden. Because only the code in the class can access or change the values of `private` instance variables, it is easier to keep track of how your program works rather than worrying that any code anywhere in a much larger program could possibly change the values of the variables.

Code in other classes can only interact with the `public` methods you provide and cannot directly access the `private` instance variables.

## Methods
`public` methods can be accessed from outside the class. You may also write `private` methods that are not accessible outside of the class and therefore can only be used by other methods inside the same class.

To call a method, we need an object that is an instance of the class. We then use the dot (.) operator to call its `public` methods

```
// call the constructor to create a new student object
Student s1 = new Student ("Ali", "alizainali@gmail.com", "773-283-2363");

//call s1's print method
s1.print();
```

## Object-Oriented Design
In object-oriented design, programmers often start by designing which classes are needed to solve a problem and then figure out the data/attributes and methods in each class. 

Once you have determined the classes you need, then you can go through the process to design individual classes.

The - in front of the attributes indicate that they are private, and the + in front of the methods indicate that they are public.
