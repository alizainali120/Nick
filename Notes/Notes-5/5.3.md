# 5.3 - Comments and Conditions

## Comments

Adding comments to your code helps to make it more readable and maintainable.

There are 3 types of comments in Java:
```
// Single line comment
/* Multiline comment */
/** Documentation comment */
```

The compiler will skip over comments, and they donâ€™t affect how your program runs. 

```
/**
* MyClass.java
* @author My Name
* @since Date
* This class keeps track of the max score.
*/
public class MyClass()
{
   private int max = 10; // this keeps track of the max score
   /* The print() method prints out the max */
   public print() {  System.out.println(max); }
```

## Preconditions and Postconditions

As you write methods in a class, it is a good idea to keep in mind the preconditions and the postconditions for the method and write them in the comments.
A precondition is a condition that must be true for your method code to work.
A postcondition is a condition that is true after running the method.

```
/**
  * Constructor that takes the grades x and y for the Math and
  * English
  * Preconditions: parameters x and y are coordinates from 0 to
  *    the width and height of the world.
  * Postconditions: Student object has the grades
  * @param x is math grade
  * @param y is english grade
  */
 public Student(int x, int y)
 {
   mathGrade = x;
   englishGrade = y;
 }
```
