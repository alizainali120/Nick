# 5.4 - Accessors / Getters

Instance variables in a class are usually marked **private** to the class. If you want the code outside the class to be able to access the value of an instance variable, you need to write **accessor/getter** methods.

A **getter** is a **public** method that **takes no arguments** and returns the value of the **private** instance variable.

```
class Example {
    // Instance variable declaration
    private int age;

    // Accessor (getter) method template
    public int getAge()
    {
        return age;
    }
}
```

```
class Student
{
    //Instance variable name
    private String name;

    /** getName() example
    *  @return name */
    public String getName()
    {
        return name;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // To call a get method, use objectName.getVarName()
        Student s = new Student();
        System.out.println("Name: " + s.getName() );
    }
}
```

Note: Methods “return by value” where a copy of the value is returned. In getter methods, when the return value is a primitive type, the value is copied. When the value is a reference to an object, the reference is copied, not the object. That means the caller receives a new copy of the reference that points to the same object as stored in the instance variable. 

## toString

Other than getter, another important method that returns a value is the **toString** method. This method is automatically called my Java in different situation when it needs to convert an object to a **String**. Examples include concatenation of object with String and calling print methods.

```
public class TesterClass
{
    // main method for testing
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Student s1 = new Student("Skyler", "skyler@sky.com", 123456);
        System.out.println(s1);
    }
}

class Student
{
    private String name;
    private String email;
    private int id;

    public Student(String initName, String initEmail, int initId)
    {
        name = initName;
        email = initEmail;
        id = initId;
    }

    // toString() method
    public String toString()
    {
        return id + ": " + name + ", " + email;
    }
}

```
