# 5.6 - Writing Methods

## Why we use methods
- Organization and Reducing Complexity: organize your program into small sections of code by function to reduce its complexity. Divide a problem into subproblems to solve it a piece at a time.
- Reusing Code: avoid repetition of code. Reuse code by putting it in a method and calling it whenever needed.
- Maintainability and Debugging: smaller methods are easier to debug and understand than searching through a large main method.

## Creating and calling a method
```
// Step 1: declare an object in main or from outside the class
Classname objectName = new Classname();

// Step 2: call the object's method
objectName.methodName(); 

// Step 3: Define the method in the class
public void methodName()
{
  // method body for the code
}
```
## Parameters
- When you create your own method, the variables you define for it in the method header are called **formal parameters**.
- When you call the method to do its job, you give or pass in **arguments** or **actual parameters** to it that are then saved in these local parameter variables.
- Java uses Call by Value when it passes arguments to methods. This means that a copy of the value in the argument is saved in the parameter variable. If the parameter variable changes its value inside the method, the original value outside the method is not changed.
