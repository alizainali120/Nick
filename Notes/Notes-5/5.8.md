# 5.8 - Scope and Access
The scope of a variable is where a variable can be accessible or can be used. 

The scope is determined by where you declare the variable when you write your programs.

Java has 3 levels of scope:
- **Class Level Scope** for **instance variables** inside a class.
- **Method Level Scope** for **local variables** (including parameter variables) inside a method.
- **Block Level Scope** for **loop variables** and other local variables defined inside of the block.
